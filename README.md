Get ready to embark on an adventure that will challenge your perceptions and leave you pondering the mysteries of the skies above. There may even be a sighting of a UFO!

The page explores Australian sightings of UFOs and provides a heatmap of aggregated sighting data by location using latitude and longitude data. The user can integrate with the map to display see the number of sightings by location. The Total Sightings by state and year presents sighting for each state by year of sighting. The line graph can be viewed in by single state or as an all state aggregate. The UFO by shape and state presents the distribution of sightings in a stacked bar graph with added tooltips. NSW has the greatest number of sightings in 2003 (19), followed by Victoria in 2004 (17) with a light shape the most common shape viewed. The final display is a line chart illustrating sightings by time brackets and is presented as an all state aggregate or by a single state by use of the drop-down. The greatest number of sightings occurs from 2000hrs for all states with variations across each state.
